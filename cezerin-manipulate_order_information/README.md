# Cezerin v0.33.0 unauthorized order information manipulation

## Detail
Cezerin is React and Node.js based eCommerce platform. The vulnerability locates at function `getValidDocumentForUpdate` in `src/api/server/services/orders/orders.js`. This function is for generating orders. However, it is found that certain internal attributes (e.g., `paid` and `tax`) in this function can be overwritten via a conflicting name from user-input. Hence, a malicious customer can manipulate certain order status (i.e., payment status, tax) by adding additional attributes to user-input during checkout. 

```
	getValidDocumentForUpdate(id, data) {
		return new Promise((resolve, reject) => {
			if (Object.keys(data).length === 0) {
				reject(new Error('Required fields are missing'));
			}

			...

			if (data.paid !== undefined) {
				order.paid = parse.getBooleanIfValid(data.paid, false);
			}

```

## PoC
1. Add any item to the chart and checkout.
2. Add additional attributes (e.g., `paid`, `tax`) to the userinput field in the request.
